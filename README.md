# shortbread

![shortbread on desk](./docs/images/desk.jpg)

Custom firmware for the **Xteink X4** e-paper device. A lean, focused build — e-reader first, with games and small utilities on the side.

## Why this exists

A couple of Xteink firmware forks caught my eye — each had something the others didn't. [biscuit](https://github.com/yattsu/biscuit) had the cleanest UI and the games. [CrossInk](https://github.com/uxjulia/CrossInk) had the best reading experience. I wanted both in one place, stripped to just the parts I actually use. So I built shortbread.

## What's in it

Five tiles on the home screen:

| Tile | Contents |

## Installing

No releases yet — manual install only.

### Prerequisites

- [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) (CLI or VS Code extension)
- Python 3.8+
- USB-C data cable

### Flash

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/deepakvettickal/shortbread
cd shortbread
pio run --target upload
```

### Build only

```bash
pio run -j 16
```

## SD card

Data is stored under `/shortbread/` on the MicroSD card (FAT32).

## Dictionary (optional)

In a book, the **Power** button enters dictionary mode — a highlight you move with the arrows. **Confirm** looks up the selected word. **Back** exits.

Lookup uses WordNet 3.1 stored on the SD card. Build the three files once on a desktop:

```bash
python3 scripts/build_dict.py --out dict_out
```

Copy the output into `/shortbread/dict/` on the SD card (~12MB):

```
/shortbread/dict/pages.idx
/shortbread/dict/words.idx
/shortbread/dict/defs.bin
```

If the files are missing, dict mode still works — the popup just shows a setup hint.

## Credits

Built on top of:

- **[crosspoint-reader](https://github.com/crosspoint-reader/crosspoint-reader)** — core EPUB engine, rendering, KOReader sync, Calibre transfer. The foundation everything runs on.
- **[biscuit](https://github.com/yattsu/biscuit)** — UI design, games, and overall architecture this fork is based on. Sorry [@yattsu](https://github.com/yattsu) — I borrowed heavily from your work and even stole the naming idea (biscuit → shortbread). Your build is what made this possible.
- **[CrossInk](https://github.com/uxjulia/CrossInk)** — reader settings menu and fonts (ChareInk, Lexend Deca).
